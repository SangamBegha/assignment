                            Nepal is home to over 125 ethnic groups, each with
                            its unique culture, traditions, and languages. These
                            groups have coexisted for centuries, contributing to
                            the country's rich cultural tapestry.

                        <p>
                            Festivals in Nepal are a reflection of its cultural
                            diversity. Major festivals like Dashain, Tihar, and
                            Holi bring people together in a spirit of joy and
                            harmony. Every ethnic group has its festivals,
                            adding vibrancy to Nepal's cultural calendar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another major festival is Tihar, also known as the
                            festival of lights. This five-day celebration honors
                            not only gods and goddesses but also animals, such
                            as crows, dogs, and cows, which hold special
                            significance in Nepali culture. Houses are
                            illuminated with oil lamps, and colorful rangolis
                            are created at doorsteps to welcome prosperity and
                            good fortune. Tihar is a beautiful demonstration of
                            the deep connection between humans and nature, as
                            well as the importance of harmony and respect for
                            all living beings.

                        <p>
                            Nepal is a secular country, yet religion plays a
                            significant role in the daily lives of its people.
                            The majority practice Hinduism, followed by
                            Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. Religious
                            tolerance and harmony are hallmarks of Nepali
                            culture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Religion in Nepal is not just a matter of belief but
                            a way of life. Festivals, ceremonies, and daily
                            prayers are integral parts of the religious
                            experience. The worship of deities, reverence for
                            nature, and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge are
                            central to the religious ethos. Despite the
                            diversity in beliefs, there is a strong sense of
                            tolerance and respect among the different religious
                            communities, contributing to Nepal's reputation as a
                            land of peace and spiritualism.

                            Traditional attire in Nepal varies by region and
                            ethnicity. The Daura Suruwal and Gunyu Cholo are
                            popular traditional dresses, symbolizing Nepal's
                            rich cultural heritage. These attires are often worn
                            during festivals and ceremonies.

                            Nepal's architecture is a blend of various
                            influences, from Newari designs to Tibetan styles.
                            The pagoda-style temples, stupas, and traditional
                            homes are architectural marvels that tell stories of
                            Nepal's artistic heritage.

                        <p>
                            Music and dance are integral to Nepali culture, with
                            each region having its unique styles. From classical
                            and folk music to modern interpretations, these art
                            forms are expressions of Nepali life, culture, and
                            traditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In urban areas, work life is more diverse, with
                            people engaged in various sectors such as tourism,
                            trade, education, and government services. The
                            tourism industry, in particular, plays a significant
                            role in the economy, providing employment
                            opportunities in hospitality, trekking, and guiding
                            services. As Nepal continues to modernize, there is
                            a growing emphasis on education and skills
                            development, with many young people aspiring to
                            careers in technology, business, and other modern
                            professions. However, traditional values of hard
                            work, dedication, and community support remain
                            central to the work ethic in Nepal.
